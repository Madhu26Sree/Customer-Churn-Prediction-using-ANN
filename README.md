# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ANN
This project focuses on predicting customer churn (whether a customer will leave or stay with a service provider) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and modeled to gain insights and build predictive models.

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses. This notebook walks through:
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Training and evaluating machine learning models
Building a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for churn prediction
Model evaluation using classification reports and confusion matrices

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python
Pandas & NumPy – data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization
Scikit-learn – preprocessing, train-test split, evaluation
TensorFlow/Keras – deep learning model
